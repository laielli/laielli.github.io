A trip to Japan in 2024 visited Tokyo, Kyoto, and Atami and had a great time at all three locations.

<h4>Walk through Arashiyama</h4>

We did a walk through Arashiyama to Otaga Nenbutsugi Temple and it turned out ot be one of my favorite lasting impressions of Japan - something about the architecture of the neighborhoods and the way the buildings are arranged.
We started the walk at the bamboo forest and then walked through the neighborhood to the temple.  The temple itself was cool, but the walk was the real highlight.  There was a pottery shop along the way
where we picked up some coffee mugs and saki sets.  One of our biggest regrets after the trip is that we didn't pick out more things there to bring home.

<h4>Restaurants and Bars</h4>

Kyoto was our favorite in terms of restaurants and bars.  We didn't really scratch the surface of what Kyoto has to offer, but here are our highlights:

<ul>
  <li>Golden Gai</li>
  <li>Nishiki Market</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tokyo</h3>
<hr>
<h4>DisneySea</h4>

We were on the fence about going to a Disney park in Japan, but this turned out to be one of our favorite experiences.
The food througout the park was a lot better than other Disney parks in the U.S.  The attractions and rides were unique and just as fun (and better maintained!) as US parks.

<h4>TeamLab Museum</h4>

The TeamLab Museum was a lot of fun.

Finding an Airbnb with a private onsen was as great as it sounds.  This place was in a really beautiful spot.  Could have spent a week just enjoying the onsen, but we took a nice walk to town through a park with a waterfall to hit some cafes, stores, and restaurants. One thing to be aware of is that the onsen isn't guaranteed to
be running, as it depends on the water flow from the mountain.  I saw maybe 1 or 2 reviews complaining that it wasn't working on their stay.
