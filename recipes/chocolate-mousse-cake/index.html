<h2>chocolate mousse cake</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>a rich chocolate cake topped with silky chocolate mousse</li>
  <li>uses an 8x8-inch baking pan</li>
</ul>

<h3>ingredients</h3>

<h4>chocolate cake batter:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2/3 cup (95g) all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (28g) cocoa powder</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
  <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60ml) sunflower oil</li>
  <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60ml) full fat sour cream</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (80ml) warm milk</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h4>chocolate mousse:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>5 oz (142g) bittersweet chocolate (70% cocoa), finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 oz (56g) milk chocolate, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2/3 cup (150ml) whole milk</li>
  <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
  <li>1/3 cup (65g) granulated sugar</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1-1/4 cups (300ml) cold heavy 35% whipping cream</li>
</ul>

<h3>instructions</h3>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8-inch metal baking pan with parchment leaving a 2-inch overhang at each side so you can easily remove the cake afterwards.</p>

<h4>step 1: make the cake</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and baking soda into a medium bowl. Add sugar and salt, then whisk to blend evenly.</li>
  <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, then add oil, beaten egg, sour cream, milk and vanilla extract and slowly whisk it in until combined and the batter is smooth.</li>
  <li>Spread batter evenly into prepared pan using a small offset spatula and bake for 20-25 minutes until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
  <li>Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely in the pan. Trim the top of the cake to level it out if necessary.</li>
</ol>

<h4>step 2: make the mousse</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Place finely chopped dark chocolate and milk chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl and set aside.</li>
  <li>Place the milk in a heatproof measuring jug and microwave for 45-60 seconds until steaming. (You can also heat it in a saucepan but be sure to cover the pot so you don't lose too much water through evaporation.)</li>
  <li>Combine egg yolks and sugar in a 1 quart stainless steel saucepan and whisk until smooth and evenly blended. Very slowly pour in the warm milk while whisking until it is all combined.</li>
  <li>Transfer the pot to the stove and stir constantly using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon over medium-low heat for 5-7 minutes until it thickens. It should coat the back of a spoon like thick cream.</li>
  <li>Immediately pour the hot custard over the chocolate, add salt and stir until smooth and the chocolate is completely melted. If necessary, microwave on low power for 20-30 seconds to melt any residual pieces. Let cool for 10-15 minutes so it is no longer hot.</li>
  <li>Place cold cream in a medium bowl and use an electric hand mixer to whip to medium peaks (somewhere between soft and stiff peaks - when you lift the beaters, the cream should curl just slightly).</li>
  <li>Take one third of the whipped cream and fold it evenly into the chocolate custard to lighten it up. Then gently fold in the remaining cream in 2 stages being careful not to deflate the air.</li>
  <li>Spoon the mousse over the cooled cake still in the pan and spread it out evenly using a small offset spatula. Place in the fridge for at least 4 hours to set.</li>
</ol>

<h4>step 3: serve</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Use a small offset spatula to release the sides of the cake/mousse from the pan where you have no parchment.</li>
  <li>Use the parchment overhang to lift it out.</li>
  <li>Sift cocoa powder over the top before slicing and serving.</li>
</ol>

<h3>tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>All purpose flour:</b> Measure correctly - adding too much flour leads to tough and dry cake. The most accurate way is using a scale. If you don't have one, fluff your flour with a spoon, spoon it into your measuring cup and use a knife to level it off.</li>
  <li><b>Cocoa powder:</b> Use good quality Dutch Process cocoa powder. Make sure it's unsweetened cocoa powder, not cocoa mix.</li>
  <li><b>Oil:</b> This is an oil-based cake because oil is liquid at room temperature, which means the cake will still be soft when cold.</li>
  <li><b>Sour cream:</b> Full fat sour cream adds richness and dairy notes in the absence of butter.</li>
  <li><b>Dark chocolate:</b> Anything between 50-70% cocoa solids will work, but 60% is recommended. You can blend semisweet with bittersweet.</li>
  <li><b>Milk chocolate:</b> Contributes additional milk solids for more body.</li>
  <li><b>Whipping cream:</b> Use heavy cream with 35% milkfat for the mousse.</li>
</ul>
