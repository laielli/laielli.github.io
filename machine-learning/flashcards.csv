question,answer
what is machine learning?,"machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed."
what is a neural network?,"a neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process and transmit information."
what is a convolutional neural network?,a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of neural network that is particularly effective for image and video recognition tasks. It uses convolutional layers to extract features from images and videos, and then uses fully connected layers to classify them.
what is a recurrent neural network?,a recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that is particularly effective for sequence data, such as text or speech. It uses recurrent connections to allow information to persist over time, and can learn to model complex patterns in data.
what is a transformer?,a transformer is a type of neural network architecture that is particularly effective for natural language processing tasks. It uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data, and can learn to model complex relationships between words and phrases.
what is a generative adversarial network?,a generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of neural network that is particularly effective for generating new data, such as images or text. It uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete with each other to generate realistic data.
what is a variational autoencoder?,a variational autoencoder (VAE) is a type of neural network that is particularly effective for generating new data, such as images or text. It uses a combination of a generator and a decoder to generate new data, and a variational loss function to ensure that the generated data is realistic.
what is a denoising autoencoder?,a denoising autoencoder (DAE) is a type of neural network that is particularly effective for removing noise from data, such as images or audio. It uses a combination of a generator and a decoder to generate new data, and a denoising loss function to ensure that the generated data is realistic.

"What is a 2D weight matrix with shape [out, in]?","A matrix W that maps an input vector x of length in to an output vector y of length out via y = W x."
"In y = W x, what are the shapes of x, y, and W?","x ∈ R^in, y ∈ R^out, W ∈ R^{out×in}."
"What is a weight update during training?","Applying a small step to weights: W <- W - η * Δ, where Δ is a (often momentum-smoothed) gradient-like update."
"What does 'dominated by a few directions' mean for a matrix update?","Most of the update’s effect is concentrated along a small number of input/output directions."
"Define anisotropy in this context.","Directional imbalance: the update stretches some directions much more than others."
"What decomposition reveals those 'directions'?","The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Δ = U Σ V^T."
"In the SVD, what are the right singular vectors (columns of V)?","Special input directions that Δ acts on."
"In the SVD, what are the left singular vectors (columns of U)?","Corresponding output directions after applying Δ."
"What do the singular values σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ ... in Σ tell you?","How strongly each singular direction is scaled by the update."
"How do singular values indicate anisotropy?","If σ1 is much larger than the rest (only a few big σi), the update is highly anisotropic."
"What does 'low-rank-ish update' imply?","Only a few singular values are large, so the update effectively has low rank and focuses on few directions."
"Give the geometric mental picture for anisotropy.","Multiplying the unit circle (or sphere) by an anisotropic matrix turns it into a skinny ellipse—heavy stretch along 1–2 axes."
"In plain terms, what is the shape [out, in] telling you?","How many outputs the layer produces (out) from how many input features it receives (in)."
"Why do we care about anisotropy in updates?","Updates that favor only a few directions can neglect other useful directions, potentially slowing or biasing learning."
